demonstration of strict-mode issue with proxyquire:
* `proxyquire-plugin` injects an IIFE at the start of scripts that `require("proxyquire")`.
* the injected IIFE is inserted before any `"use strict"` statement in the script,
[invalidating strict-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).
* to work around this behaviour, the script can for example be encapsulated
in a strict-mode function, e.g. an IIFE or a describe block.

the demo is based on the differing interpretation of "this" in an unbound function:
* `undefined` in strict mode
* `window` in non-strict mode (in the browser)
